As an SEO expert, I have been running my own company for 7 years in the software industry. I am experienced in topics such as choosing focus keywords and creating content, using the Google Ads panel, Keyword Planner, SEMrush and Screaming Frog, ensuring that the articles rank high in the SERPs, and preparing snippet compatible content and visuals. I know enough about Google algorithm updates. I have a high level of knowledge and experience in getting a website on the first page or even a snippet in a related search. I have brought many companies to place they deserve with my frontend knowledge and the algorithms that I developed on my own. I see software development as a bottomless pit and SEO as a game of chess. Good people always win.
